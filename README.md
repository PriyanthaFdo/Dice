+ [ ] -

## Other TODOs
+ [ ] - make backgrounds of the app randomnly be selected from the available background files
+ [ ] - use splashscreen API to make the splash screen
+ [ ] - animate splash screen logo
+ [ ] - exclusions, min, max in random number generator activity



#### ~I look forward to publish the finished app to play store if possible~
I found out that in order to publish an app on playstore, I must first create an account for around LKR 8000/=
